## About the Book

Solid may seem simple on the surface, but its internal workings involve complex interactions that can sometimes be tricky to explain.

It is a comprehensive book that aims to teach you the ins and outs of Solid, covering its core principles, the inner workings, and the API. By the end of this book, you will have a thorough understanding of SolidJS to write efficient applications.

The book goes beyond just showing you how to use SolidJS; it explains the reasoning and underlying principles behind the library, helping you understand why certain approaches or features work the way they do. With this deeper comprehension, you’ll be well-equipped to build your own projects confidently.

I did my best to organize the topics in a way not to overwhelm the readers and to enhance progressive learning, with examples that focus on the subject matter without introducing unnecessary complexity.

I would love to hear your feedback on how the book has helped you understand SolidJS better, or any questions you might have!
